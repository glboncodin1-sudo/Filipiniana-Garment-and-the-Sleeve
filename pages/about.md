## About the Collection
"SLEEVEvolution: A Digital Archive of Filipino Identity through the Filipiniana sleeves" is a curated collection of visual and textual materials documenting the historical and architectural transformation of the Filipiniana sleeve. This collection features garments spanning a wide timeline,from 1937 to 2024. The collection emphasizes the definitive shift from the soft, draped colonial sleeve to the flat, rigid butterfly silhouette.
‎
The site highlights works by fashion icons such as National Artists Ramon Valera and Salvacion Lim Higgins, alongside celebrated modern designers, Yssa Inumerable and Len Cabili among others. Our visual dataset, critical for tracing morphological change, includes access to more than 10 archival images. Primary image sources are derived from institutional collections, notably the VOGUE Philippines, and online websites such as Artes de las Filipinas, and How the Terno Took Shape.

## About the Project
The Filipiniana is the comprehensive term for traditional Filipino female attire, encompassing forms like the Baro’t Saya, Maria Clara, and Terno. As the Filipiniana continues to evolve, it also develops our national identity. However, documentation of the technical, material, and social histories of Filipiniana sleeves remains fragmented across museum sites and scattered archival photographs.

In this regard, SLEEVEvolution aims to address the lack of accessible and interactive visualization regarding the evolution of Filipiniana sleeves. This project utilized direct searching, chaining, and browsing to locate relevant content, followed by rigorous gathering, organizing, and assessing of data. The project also relied on various tools, including data collection, image sourcing, text annotation, and website development via CollectionBuilder and GitHub Pages. It documents sleeve evolution as a focus of material culture, colonial encounter, and contemporary fashion politics. It also aims to preserve technical knowledge, support research and teaching, and broaden public access to the cultural narratives embedded in Filipiniana sleeve traditions.
